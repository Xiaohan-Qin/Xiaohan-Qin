### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m a graduate computer science student at Northeastern University.
- ğŸŒ± I'm trying to build some simple and fun projects here once in a while. 
- ğŸ˜Š I'm always happy to collabrate on any projects that are innovative, powerful, increase diversity, or benefit the public good.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My name means "slightly cold" in Chinese because I was born on a cold winter night.
- ğŸ“« Nice to meet you! Feel free to reach me at qinxhannah@outlook.com.
