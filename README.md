### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m a graduate computer science student at Northeastern University.
- ğŸŒ± I'm trying to build some fun projects here once in a while. 
- ğŸ˜Š I'm happy to collabrate on projects that are innovative, inspiring, and powerful.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My name means "slightly cold" in Chinese because I was born on a cold winter night.
